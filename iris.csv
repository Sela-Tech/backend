PI6372,Client Individuals: Smallholder,Number of unique smallholder farmer individuals who were clients during the reporting period.,Organizations should footnote all assumptions used. See usage guidance for further information.,,"This metric is intended to capture the number of unique smallholder farmer clients who were recipients of the organization's products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic. It is also not intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should only be counted once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals serviced. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this number. If organizations consider the entire household to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Organizations that rely on assumptions to report against this metric, including the process for determining the number of client individuals, should footnote all assumptions used in the calculation process.

For healthcare providers, client individuals refers to patients. For housing providers, client individuals refers to residents or tenants.

This metric is multi-dimensional in regards to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

This metric may be reported in conjunction with Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its various submetrics. 

Organizations that provide products and services that are used by an entire household (clean cookstoves, home weatherization, etc.) might find it more appropriate to report on the number of client households served rather than the number of the client individuals. By multiplying the number of Client Households by the Client Household Size, organizations can get an estimate of the number of individuals served. For example, an organization that sells products to 100 Client Households with a Client Household Size of 5 could estimate that they served 500 individuals.

Organizations that rely on assumptions to report against this metric should footnote all assumptions used in the calculation process. Organizations can refer to the following sources for additional information on determining client household sizes, in addition to national census information:

See usage guidance for further information.",(average wage paid to female employees in a specified position) / (average wage paid to male employees in the same position),"If the average wage paid to women and men for the same position was the same, the ratio would be ""1"".

This ratio can be used for salaried employees with fixed wages or for employees with variable salaries (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, other specified time cycle, or other specified parameter).

Organizations should footnote the specific position(s) they use to calculate this ratio, including whether the position is a managerial or non-managerial role. For example, organizations reporting this metric for multiple positions are encouraged to report various data points for gender wage equity and specify the position to which the data points correspond.

While this metric helps organizations begin to understand gender wage equity in their operations, organizations are cautioned that other factors may affect the data collected. For example, the average wages reported for this metric may only be meaningful if there are multiple individuals of both genders in a similar position within the organization. Additionally, factors such as employee education, experience, tenure at the organization, and others may also influence wage disparities.

To source data points for average wages paid to employees in comparable positions at similar organizations, organizations can refer to resources issued by independent, third-party research bodies within their respective countries of operation. For example, organizations operating in the United States may refer to wage data by area and occupation published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm).

- An organization that produces wind power from wind farms could indicate the environment as its target stakeholder.
- An organization buying mangoes from co-operatives that source from smallholder farmers could indicate suppliers as its target stakeholder.
- An organization that recruits, trains, and employs chronically underemployed populations could indicate employees as its target stakeholder.
- An organization engaging women in poor rural areas as distributors of its products and services could indicate distributors as its target stakeholder.
- An organization manufacturing and selling water purification tablets could indicate clients/customers as its target stakeholder.

Organizations are encouraged to report against IRIS metrics related to the numbers reached and other key performance areas. For example, the organization that buys mangoes referenced above might also report against Supplier Individuals: Smallholder (PI9991) and Payments to Supplier Individuals: Smallholder (PI7852).

PI2251,Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Low Income Areas,"Net number of new full-time equivalent employees living in low income areas working for enterprises financed or supported by the organization between the beginning and end of the reporting period.

Many organizations may choose the beginning of the reporting period to be the time when the organization began its support/investment.",Organizations should footnote all assumptions used. Organizations that report data using more than one reporting period should make very apparent which reporting period they are using for this metric. See usage guidance for further information.,,"This metric is intended to capture the jobs created from the time of investment/support until the end of the reporting period in low income areas. This metric is most likely applicable for organizations involved in the financial and land conservation categories

Adding Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) to Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) should be equivalent to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI4874).

For example, a microfinance organization provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period. In this example, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.

Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information on defining low income areas. 

While this metric requests full-time equivalent job information, organizations are encouraged to also provide the breakdown of this data for full-time and part-time positions supported/financed. Organizations can refer to the full-time equivalent glossary term for more detail. In calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20 hour/week job would be equal to 0.5 FTE job). Both full-time and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number of employees employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked throughout the reporting period (e.g., a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job). Note that in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. See glossary definition for more information on how to calculate full-time equivalent.

Wastewater is water that carries wastes and is usually a mixture of water and dissolved or suspended solids. 

Treatment for wastewater refers to the goal of achieving improvements in the quality of the wastewater before the remaining water is discharged back to the environment. The treatment process may reduce suspended solids, biodegradable organics, pathogenic bacteria, and nutrients. There are typically three levels of wastewater treatment: primary (mechanical), secondary (biological), and tertiary.

This metric can also be understood as a “Net Promoter Score.” For further information and guidance on this calculation, see NetPromoter.com. Organizations can use the question “How likely is it that you would recommend [product/service] to a friend or colleague?” to collect data from clients against this metric. Respondents should rank their likelihood to recommend on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing “not at all likely to recommend,” 10 representing “extremely likely to recommend,” and 5 representing “neutral.” Clients ranking themselves as a 9 or 10 are considered “extremely likely” or “Promoters.” Clients ranking themselves as a 7 or 8 are considered “Passives.” Clients ranking themselves as 0-6 are considered “unlikely” or “Detractors.”

Users may report this metric with Client Feedback System (OI5049) as the system by which this feedback is solicited.
